## Dependencies

* numpy

Python 2 and 3 both work for this. Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install any dependencies.

## Usage

Just run ``python3 linear_regression.py`` to see the results:

   ```
Starting gradient descent at b = 0, m = 0, error = 5565.107834483211

After 1000 iterations b = 0.08893651993741346, m = 1.4777440851894448, error = 112.61481011613473
   ```
